      <h3> Tamkang University, Tamsui, Taiwan (2017 - 2022)
      </h3>
      <p>My undergraduate journey at Tamkang University in Tamsui, Taiwan, was marked by a profound exploration of English and French language and literature. Pursuing dual Bachelor of Arts degrees in both disciplines, I engaged in rigorous academic coursework that deepened my understanding of linguistic principles, literary analysis, and cultural contexts.
      </p> 
      <p>My responsibilities encompassed designing and delivering engaging cultural activities and language courses, including the highly successful "Semaine du Nouvel An chinois" and "Journ√©e Portes Ouvertes." I adeptly instructed students on various aspects of Chinese language and culture, including grammar, writing, and pronunciation, fostering a dynamic and immersive learning environment.  
      </p>
      <p>TBeyond the classroom, I actively participated in extracurricular activities, including contributing as a violinist to the university orchestra. These experiences not only enriched my academic pursuits but also fostered a holistic personal and professional development grounded in cultural appreciation and interdisciplinary collaboration.
